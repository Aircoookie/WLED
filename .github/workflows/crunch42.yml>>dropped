# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

# This workflow locates REST API file contracts (Swagger or OpenAPI format, v2 and v3, JSON and YAML)
# and runs 300+ security checks on them using 42Crunch Security Audit technology to uncover
# potential vulnerabilities related to authentication, authorization as well as data validation.
#
# Documentation is located here: https://docs.42crunch.com/latest/content/tasks/integrate_github_actions.htm
#
# To use this workflow, you need a 42Crunch platform account. If you do not have one, you can contact us
# from this page: https://42crunch.com/request-demo.
#
# 1. Follow steps at https://docs.42crunch.com/latest/content/tasks/integrate_github_actions.htm
#    to create an API Token on the 42Crunch platform
#
# 2. Create an secret in GitHub as explained in https://docs.42crunch.com/latest/content/tasks/integrate_github_actions.htm
#    and store the 42Crunch API Token in that secret. Expected default is API_TOKEN (see the api-token property in the task).
#
# If you have any questions or need help, open an issue at: https://support.42crunch.com.
