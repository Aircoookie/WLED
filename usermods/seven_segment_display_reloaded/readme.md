# Seven Segment Display Reloaded

Uses the overlay feature to create a configurable seven segment display.
Optimized for maximum configurability and use with seven segment clocks by parallyze (https://www.instructables.com/member/parallyze/instructables/)
Very loosely based on the existing usermod "seven segment display".


## Installation

Add the compile-time option `-D USERMOD_SSDR` to your `platformio.ini` (or `platformio_override.ini`) or use `#define USERMOD_SSDR` in `my_config.h`.

For the auto brightness option, the usermod SN_Photoresistor has to be installed as well. See SN_Photoresistor/readme.md for instructions.

## Settings
All settings can be controlled via the usermod settings page.
Part of the settings can be controlled through MQTT with a raw payload or through a json request to /json/state.

### enabled
Enables/disables this usermod

### inverted
Enables the inverted mode in which the background should be enabled and the digits should be black (LEDs off)

### Colon-blinking
Enables the blinking colon(s) if they are defined

### enable-auto-brightness
Enables the auto brightness feature. Can be used only when the usermod SN_Photoresistor is installed.

### auto-brightness-min / auto-brightness-max
The lux value calculated from usermod SN_Photoresistor will be mapped to the values defined here.
The mapping, 0 - 1000 lux, will be mapped to auto-brightness-min and auto-brightness-max

WLED current protection will override the calculated value if it is too high.

### Display-Mask
Defines the type of the time/date display. 
For example "H:m" (default)
- H - 00-23 hours
- h - 01-12 hours
- k - 01-24 hours
- m - 00-59 minutes
- s - 00-59 seconds
- d - 01-31 day of month
- M - 01-12 month
- y - 21 last two positions of year
- Y - 2021 year
- : for a colon

### LED-Numbers
- LED-Numbers-Hours
- LED-Numbers-Minutes
- LED-Numbers-Seconds
- LED-Numbers-Colons
- LED-Numbers-Day
- LED-Numbers-Month
- LED-Numbers-Year

See following example for usage.


## Example

Example of an LED definition:
```
  <  A  >
/\       /\
F        B
\/       \/
  <  G  >
/\       /\
E        C
\/       \/
  <  D  >
```

LEDs or Range of LEDs are separated by a comma ","

Segments are separated by a semicolon ";" and are read as A;B;C;D;E;F;G

Digits are separated by colon ":" -> A;B;C;D;E;F;G:A;B;C;D;E;F;G

Ranges are defined as lower to higher (lower first)

For example, a clock definition for the following clock (https://www.instructables.com/Lazy-7-Quick-Build-Edition/) is

- hour "59,46;47-48;50-51;52-53;54-55;57-58;49,56:0,13;1-2;4-5;6-7;8-9;11-12;3,10"

- minute "37-38;39-40;42-43;44,31;32-33;35-36;34,41:21-22;23-24;26-27;28,15;16-17;19-20;18,25"

or

- hour "6,7;8,9;11,12;13,0;1,2;4,5;3,10:52,53;54,55;57,58;59,46;47,48;50,51;49,56"

- minute "15,28;16,17;19,20;21,22;23,24;26,27;18,25:31,44;32,33;35,36;37,38;39,40;42,43;34,41"

depending on the orientation.

# Example details:
hour "59,46;47-48;50-51;52-53;54-55;57-58;49,56:0,13;1-2;4-5;6-7;8-9;11-12;3,10"

there are two digits separated by ":"

- 59,46;47-48;50-51;52-53;54-55;57-58;49,56
- 0,13;1-2;4-5;6-7;8-9;11-12;3,10

In the first digit, 
the **segment A** consists of the LEDs number **59 and 46**., **segment B** consists of the LEDs number **47, 48** and so on

The second digit starts again with **segment A** and LEDs **0 and 13**, **segment B** consists of the LEDs number **1 and 2** and so on

### first digit of the hour
- Segment A: 59, 46
- Segment B: 47, 48
- Segment C: 50, 51
- Segment D: 52, 53
- Segment E: 54, 55
- Segment F: 57, 58
- Segment G: 49, 56

### second digit of the hour

- Segment A: 0, 13
- Segment B: 1, 2
- Segment C: 4, 5
- Segment D: 6, 7
- Segment E: 8, 9
- Segment F: 11, 12
- Segment G: 3, 10
