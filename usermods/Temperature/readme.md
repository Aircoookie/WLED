# Temperature usermod

Based on the excellent `QuinLED_Dig_Uno_Temp_MQTT` usermod by srg74 and 400killer!  
Reads an attached DS18B20 temperature sensor (as available on the QuinLED Dig-Uno)  
Temperature is displayed in both the Info section of the web UI as well as published to the `/temperature` MQTT topic, if enabled.  
May be expanded with support for different sensor types in the future.

If temperature sensor is not detected during boot, this usermod will be disabled.

## Installation

Copy the example `platformio_override.ini` to the root directory.  This file should be placed in the same directory as `platformio.ini`.

### Define Your Options

* `USERMOD_DALLASTEMPERATURE`                      - enables this user mod wled00/usermods_list.cpp
* `USERMOD_DALLASTEMPERATURE_MEASUREMENT_INTERVAL` - number of milliseconds between measurements, defaults to 60000 ms (60s)

All parameters can be configured at runtime via the Usermods settings page, including pin, temperature in degrees Celsius or Farenheit and measurement interval.

### PlatformIO requirements

If you are using `platformio_override.ini`, you should be able to refresh the task list and see your custom task, for example `env:d1_mini_usermod_dallas_temperature_C`.

If you are not using `platformio_override.ini`, you might have to uncomment `OneWire@~2.3.5 under` `[common]` section in `platformio.ini`:

```ini
# platformio.ini
...
[platformio]
...
; default_envs = esp07
default_envs = d1_mini
...
[common]
...
lib_deps =
  ...
  #For Dallas sensor uncomment following line
  OneWire@~2.3.7
  # ... or you may want to use following with ESP32
;  https://github.com/blazoncek/OneWire.git # fixes Sensor error on ESP32...
```
