### Usermods

This folder serves as a repository for usermods (custom `usermod.cpp` files)!

If you have created an usermod that you believe is useful (for example to support a particular sensor, display, feature...), feel free to contribute by opening a pull request!

In order for other people to be able to have fun with your usermod, please keep these points in mind:

-   Create a folder in this folder with a descriptive name (for example `usermod_ds18b20_temp_sensor_mqtt`)  
-   Include your custom `usermod.cpp` file  
-   If your usermod requires changes to other WLED files, please write a `readme.md` outlining the steps one has to take to use the usermod  
-   Create a pull request!  
-   If your feature is useful for the majority of WLED users, I will consider adding it to the base code!  

While I do my best to not break too much, keep in mind that as WLED is being updated, usermods might break.  
I am not actively maintaining any usermod in this directory, that is your responsibility as the creator of the usermod.

Thank you for your help :)
