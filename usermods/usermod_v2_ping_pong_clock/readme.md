# Ping Pong LED Clock

This Usermod File contains a modification to use WLED in combination with the Ping Pong Ball LED Clock as built in [Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/Ping-Pong-Ball-LED-Clock/).

## Installation 

To install this Usermod you instruct PlatformIO to compile the Projekt with the USERMOD_PING_PONG_CLOCK flag. WLED then automatically provides you with various settings in the Usermod Page to configure this Usermod.    
Note: If your clock is bigger or smaller then mine, you may have to update the led indices for the indivdual numbers and the base indices.
