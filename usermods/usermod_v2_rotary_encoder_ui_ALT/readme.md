# Rotary Encoder UI Usermod ALT

Thank you to the authors of the original version of these usermods. It would not have been possible without them!
"usermod_v2_four_line_display" (old but gold, removed since release 0.15.0)
"usermod_v2_rotary_encoder_ui" (old but gold, removed since release 0.15.0)

The core of these usermods are a copy of the originals, the changes made to the RotaryEncoder usermod were made to support the new UI in the display usermod.

## Functionalities

Press the encoder to cycle through the options:
* Brightness
* Speed
* Intensity
* Palette
* Effect
* Main Color (only if display is used)
* Saturation (only if display is used)

Press and hold the encoder to display Network Info. If AP is active, it will display the AP, SSID and Password

Also shows if the timer is enabled.
