## Features
 - 🌡️ Adds the internal temperature readout of the chip to the `Info` tab
 - 🥵 High temperature indicator/action. (Configurable threshold and preset)
 - 📣 Publishes the internal temperature over the MQTT topic: `mcutemp`


## Use Examples
- Warn of excessive/damaging temperatures by the triggering of a 'warning' preset
- Activate a cooling fan (when used with the multi-relay usermod)


## Compatibility
- A shown temp of 53,33°C might indicate that the internal temp is not supported
- ESP8266 does not have a internal temp sensor -> Disabled (Indicated with a readout of '-1')
- ESP32S2 seems to crash on reading the sensor -> Disabled (Indicated with a readout of '-1')


## Installation
- Add `Internal_Temperature` to `custom_usermods` in your `platformio.ini` (or `platformio_override.ini`).
