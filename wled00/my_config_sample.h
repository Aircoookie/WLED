/*
 * Welcome! 
 * You can use the file "my_config.h" to make changes to the way WLED is compiled!
 * It is possible to enable and disable certain features as well as set defaults for some runtime changeable settings.
 * 
 * How to use:
 * PlatformIO: Just compile the unmodified code once! The file "my_config.h" will be generated automatically and now you can make your changes.
 * 
 * ArduinoIDE: Make a copy of this file and name it "my_config.h". Go to wled.h and uncomment "#define WLED_USE_MY_CONFIG" in the top of the file.
 * 
 * DO NOT make changes to the "my_config_sample.h" file directly! Your changes will not be applied.
