This library enables you to **send _and_ receive** infra-red signals on an [ESP8266](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino) or an
[ESP32](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32) using the [Arduino framework](https://www.arduino.cc/) using common 940nm IR LEDs and common IR receiver modules. e.g. TSOP{17,22,24,36,38,44,48}* demodulators etc.

## v2.7.2 Now Available
Version 2.7.2 of the library is now [available](https://github.com/crankyoldgit/IRremoteESP8266/releases/latest). You can view the [Release Notes](ReleaseNotes.md) for all the significant changes.

#### Upgrading from pre-v2.0
Usage of the library has been slightly changed in v2.0. You will need to change your usage to work with v2.0 and beyond. You can read more about the changes required on our [Upgrade to v2.0](https://github.com/crankyoldgit/IRremoteESP8266/wiki/Upgrading-to-v2.0) page.

#### Upgrading from pre-v2.5
The library has changed from using constants declared as `#define` to
[const](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Constant_Names) with
the appropriate naming per the
[C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).
This may potentially cause old programs to not compile.
The most likely externally used `#define`s have been _aliased_ for limited
backward compatibility for projects using the old style. Going forward, only the
new `kConstantName` style will be supported for new protocol additions.

In the unlikely case, it does break your code, then you may have been referencing
something you likely should not have. You should be able to quickly determine
the new name from the old. e.g. `CONSTANT_NAME` to `kConstantName`.
Use common sense or examining the library's code if this does affect code.

## Supported Protocols

## Library History
This library was originally based on Ken Shirriff's work (https://github.com/shirriff/Arduino-IRremote/)

[Mark Szabo](https://github.com/crankyoldgit/IRremoteESP8266) has updated the IRsend class to work on ESP8266 and [Sebastien Warin](https://github.com/sebastienwarin/IRremoteESP8266) the receiving & decoding part (IRrecv class).

As of v2.0, the library was almost entirely re-written with the ESP8266's resources in mind.
