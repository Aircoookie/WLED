- Much more precise timing for generation of signals sent.
- Lower duty-cycles for some protocols.
- Several new protocols added, and some new sending and decoding routines for existing ones.
- Ability to optionally chose which protocols are included, enabling faster decoding and smaller code footprints if desired.
- Support for far larger capture buffers. (e.g. RAWLEN > 256)

**[Bug fixes]**
- Numerous bug fixes.


## _v1.2.0 (20170429)_

**[Features]**
- Add ability to copy IR capture buffer, and continue capturing. Means faster and better IR command decoding.
- Reduce IRAM usage by 28 bytes.
- Improve capture of RC-MM & Panasonic protocols.
- Upgrade IRrecvDumpV2 to new IR capture buffer. Much fewer corrupted/truncated IR messages.


## _v1.1.1 (20170413)_

**[Bug fixes]**
- Fix a reported problem when sending the LG protocol. Preemptive fix for possible similar cases.
- Fix minor issues in examples.

**[Features]**
- Add documentation to some examples to aid new people.
- Add ALPHA support for RC-MM protocol. (Known to be currently not 100% working.)
