 * This v1 usermod file allows you to add own functionality to WLED more easily
 * See: https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED/wiki/Add-own-functionality
 * EEPROM bytes 2750+ are reserved for your custom use case. (if you extend #define EEPSIZE in const.h)
 * If you just need 8 bytes, use 2551-2559 (you do not need to increase EEPSIZE)
 * 
 * Consider the v2 usermod API if you need a more advanced feature set!
