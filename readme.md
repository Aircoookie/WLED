## Welcome to my project WLED!

A fast and feature-rich implementation of an ESP8266/ESP32 webserver to control NeoPixel (WS2812B, WS2811, SK6812, APA102) LEDs!

### Features:
- WS2812FX library integrated for almost 100 special effects  
- FastLED noise effects and palettes  
- Modern UI with color, effect and segment controls  
- Segments to set different effects and colors to parts of the LEDs  
- Settings page - configuration over network  
- Access Point and station mode - automatic failsafe AP  
- Support for RGBW strips  
- 16 user presets to save and load colors/effects easily, supports cycling through them.  
- Macro functions to automatically execute API calls  
- Nightlight function (gradually dims down)  
- Full OTA software updatability (HTTP + ArduinoOTA), password protectable  
- Configurable analog clock + support for the Cronixie kit by Diamex  
- Configurable Auto Brightness limit for safer operation  

### Supported light control interfaces:
- WLED app for Android and iOS  
- JSON and HTTP request APIs  
- MQTT  
- Blynk IoT  
- E1.31  
- Hyperion  
- UDP realtime  
- Alexa voice control (including dimming and color)  
- Sync to Philips hue lights  
- Adalight (PC ambilight via serial)  
- Sync color of multiple WLED devices (UDP notifier)  
- Infrared remotes (24-key RGB, receiver required)  
- Simple timers/schedules (time from NTP, timezones/DST supported)
