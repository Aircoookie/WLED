# HyperSerialWLED
Fork of the WLED project where the Adalight USB serial protocol @115200 speed is replaced with the AWA protocol with data integrity check at @2000000 speed for use with [HyperHDR](https://github.com/awawa-dev/HyperHDR). At this point only version for ESP8266 was tested and it's working.<br/><br/>
