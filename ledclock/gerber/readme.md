# Gerber files

All files were downloaded from [EasyEDA](https://easyeda.com/). You can order the PCBs simply using these archives.

The main board has two flavours. In the original design I used SMD connectors but later realized that the THT versions are much cheaper and easier to get, so I also included a version that uses THT connectors.
