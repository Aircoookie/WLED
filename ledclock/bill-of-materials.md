# Bill of Materials

This page lists all parts and materials required to build the clock.

## 3D-printing

To be able to print the base of the enclosure, a printer with a large build volume is required, since its ~40 cm wide. All other parts can be printed on a regular sized printers.

You need at least two kinds of material, an opaque and a translucent one. See the tables on [this page](models/3d-print/readme.md) for the details and required amounts.

## Electronics

First of all, you need the PCBs. Making them yourself could be quite a challenge since tha main board is a double sided design and the other two boards have a non-square outline which can be best CNC-milled or hand made with a router. Therefore I would recommend ordering them form a prototyping PCB service. I had them made at JLC PCB and the quality they arrived in is very convincing. Check out the [designs](sch-pcb/readme.md) and [gerber files](gerber/readme.md).

The following table shows the required components. The datasheets show the exact pieces I used in my design and realization.
